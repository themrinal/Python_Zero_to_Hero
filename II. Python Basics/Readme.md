# **Chapter II: Python Basics**

Welcome to **Chapter II: Python Basics** of the **Python - Zero to Hero** series. This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of Python, including syntax, variables, data types, and more. Note that I have used Jypiter Notebook to write and execute the programs.

## 📖 Topics Covered

1. **Basic Syntax** - Understanding Python indentation, comments, and case sensitivity.
2. **Variables & Data Types** - Declaring variables and understanding different data types in Python.
3. **Inputs & Type Casting** - Taking user input and converting data types.
4. **Literals in Python** - Exploring string, numeric, and boolean literals.
5. **Comments in Python** - Using single-line and multi-line comments effectively.

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the basic syntax and structure of Python programs.
- Work with different data types and variables.
- Accept user inputs and convert between data types.
- Use literals to define constants and values in Python.
- Write clean and well-documented code using comments.
